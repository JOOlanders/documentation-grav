Before going through integration is important that you are familiar with the [Dynamic Content](https://yootheme.com/support/yootheme-pro/joomla/dynamic-content) workflow and the [Sources Manager](manager).

1. Navigate to `Customizer -> Essentials -> Sources`.
1. Add a Source of type {% $source %}.
1. Follow through the [instance configuration](#instance), then press the Save button.

At this point a new {% $source %} Source instance has been created and is available for mapping in any Builder Element.

1. Navigate to `Customizer -> Builder`.
1. Add a new Element to a layout and access it Advanced Tab settings.
1. Set as Dynamic Content one of the [queries](#queries) from the Group {% $source %}.
1. Go back to the Element Content Tab and [map](https://yootheme.com/support/yootheme-pro/joomla/dynamic-content#field-mapping) the content to the fields as necessary.
