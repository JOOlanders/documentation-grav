# ZOOlanders Documentation

The documentation is based on [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev) with integration of [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com) search indexing.

## Getting started

First install the npm dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Finally, open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser to view the website. In case the port is occupied by another service, the next available port will be used and exposed in the console.
