# Getting Started

[Layouts](https://zoolanders.com/essentials-for-yootheme-pro/layouts) addon extends the YOOtheme Pro Builder with the ability to create multiple & cross-site [Layout Libraries](https://yootheme.com/support/yootheme-pro/joomla/layout-library) from local or external storages.

Let's create our first Library from a local storage.

1. Access _**Essentials**_ -> _**Layout Libraries**_ section in the YOOtheme Pro Customizer.
1. Notice that existing libraries will be listed in this section.
1. Now click on the *New Library* button and set a Name for our custom library.
1. In the storage field create a new Local storage setting a folder of your choice.
1. Click the *Save* button to confirm the library creation.
1. At this point the new library will become available as part of the Builder _Library_ and _Elements Presets_ workflow.
