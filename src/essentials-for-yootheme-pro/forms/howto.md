# How To

## Submit Contextual/Additional Data

Sometimes a submission should have a reference to the context in which was submitted, like the Datetime or the page URL. Currently the workaround for it is to add a _Hidden Input_ element to the form mapped with a dynamic content, eg `Request -> Timestamp`.

## Show the Form in a Modal

We don't have an out of a box solution for it, but 3rd parties do, we recommend [DJ-Popup](https://dj-extensions.com/yootheme/dj-popup), [FS Teaser Card](https://flart.studio/yootheme-pro/teaser-card) or [JP CE Modal Pro](https://extensions.joomlapro.com/product/ce-modal-pro).
