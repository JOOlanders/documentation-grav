# Introduction

[Forms](https://zoolanders.com/essentials-for-yootheme-pro/forms) addon extends YOOtheme Pro builder with a submission workflow, allowing for any `section` or `column` element to become a composable Form Area.

Multiple Form Areas on the same page are supported keeping the full builder capabilities, as such complex form layouts can be built combining any kind of elements.

Submissions are double validated by the HTML5 in browser validation as well as server side via an ajax request. Validated forms will be finally submitted and only then [After Submit Actions](./configuration.html#after-submit-actions) triggered, which will run consequently allowing for an effective and simple way to set custom form submission workflows.
