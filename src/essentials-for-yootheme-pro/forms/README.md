# Introduction

[Forms](https://zoolanders.com/essentials-for-yootheme-pro/forms) addon extends YOOtheme Pro builder with a submission workflow, allowing for any `section` or `column` element to become a Form Area with full builder capabilities.

Submissions are double validated by HTML5 in-browser validation as well as server-side via an ajax request. Validated forms will be finally submitted and only then [After Submit Actions](./actions.md) triggered, which will run consequently allowing for an effective and simple way to set custom form submission workflows.

By default, no submission is saved or recorded, being up to the After Submit Actions to do so, for example setting up a _Save to CSV_ action.
