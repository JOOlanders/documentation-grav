# Getting Started

[Sources](https://zoolanders.com/essentials-for-yootheme-pro/sources) addon extends the YOOtheme Pro Builder with the ability to create custom [Dynamic Content](https://yootheme.com/support/yootheme-pro/joomla/dynamic-content) sources from structured data files and external services, such as CSV files, Google Sheets, or Instagram.

Let's create our first Database source as an example and map its contents to an element of our choice. It's very simple!

1. Access _**Essentials**_ -> _**Content Sources**_ section in the YOOtheme Pro Customizer.
1. Notice that existing sources will be listed in this section.
1. Now click on the *New Source* button and choose _Database_ in the emerging modal.
1. Optionally set a name that will be a reference to this source instance.
1. Choose a table in the *Table Field* and leave the rest as per default.
1. Click the *Save* button to confirm the source creation.
1. At this point the new source will become available as part of the _Dynamic Content_ workflow under the _Database_ group.

  <source src="./assets/configuration.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Browser does not support the video tag.

For further details on how to use and map dynamic content on your layout elements, please refer to the YOOtheme Pro [Dynamic Content documentation](https://yootheme.com/support/yootheme-pro/joomla/dynamic-content). For details about specific source configuration and mapping settings, continue to the next section.
