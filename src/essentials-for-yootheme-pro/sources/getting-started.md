# Getting Started

Let's create our first source which later on can be used to map its contents to an element of our choice.

1. **Create a New Source**. Enter the `Sources` section and create a new one by clicking the *New Source* button. A modal will popup with a form.
2. **Set Up the Name**. Write a name for the new source. This name will be used as a source reference displayed in the `Dynamic Content` selection list.
3. **Choose the Source**. Choose one of the available sources.
4. **Fulfill the Options**. Each source has its options, the CSV provider requires to select a locally-stored CSV file.
5. **Save the Source**. After pressing `Save` on the modal the new source will appear listed.
6. **Map the Source Content**. At this point, the source content will be available for mapping it to an element. Follow the [official Yootheme docs](https://yootheme.com/support/yootheme-pro/joomla/dynamic-content) for more details about it.
