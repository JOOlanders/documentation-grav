# Instagram

This source allows you to create content from **Personal** and **Business** Instagram accounts or pages. A Personal account will allow you to display the images from your own Instagram account, but not from any of the pages you manage. The Professional account will instead allow you to display media from any of the pages to which your **Facebook** account manages, but not any of your Personal ones. If you have both, simply create two or more sources.

In order to have access to the media, you will have to grant permission to the _ZOOlanders OAuth App_, which process is done during the source configuration.
