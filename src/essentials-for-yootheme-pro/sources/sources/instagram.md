# Instagram

This source is based on Media from Personal and Business Instagram accounts. A Personal account will allow you to display the images from your own Instagram account, but not from any of the Facebook pages you manage. The Professional account will instead allow you to display media from Facebook pages [associated](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/898752960195806) with an Instagram account, but not any of your Personal ones. If you have both, simply create two or more sources.

Once the source has been created, as instructed in the [Getting Started](../sources/#getting-started) guide, you will be able to map its contents to any Builder element.

The cache is set to `3600` seconds by default, if your workflow requires immediate results disable the cache by setting it to `0`, but being this an API-driven source it is not recommended.

::: tip
This source requires granting permission to the _ZOOlanders OAuth App_, but you can also create your Facebook App and use it instead.
