# TikTok

This source is based on Media from TikTok. Once the source has been created, as instructed in the [Getting Started](../) guide, you will be able to map its contents to any Builder element.

The cache is set to `3600` seconds by default, if your workflow requires immediate results disable the cache by setting it to `0`, but being this an API-driven source it is not recommended.

::: tip
This source requires granting permission to the _ZOOlanders OAuth App_, but you can also create your TikTok App and use it instead.
