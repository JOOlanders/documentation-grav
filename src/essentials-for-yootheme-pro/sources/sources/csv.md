# CSV

This source allows you to create content from **locally-stored CSV files**. The CSV file **must have a header**, which means the first line of the CSV file must contain the column names that will be used as the field name during the content mapping.

When the source is being set as the element Dynamic Content you can choose how many records to fetch by setting an **offset** and a **limit**.
