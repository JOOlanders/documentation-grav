# Upgrade

The upgrade from Essentials Freemium to Premium version is as simple as [installing](./installation) the premium package without uninstalling the freemium one. The upgrade process must be done manually, after that automatic updates will take over.

## Upgrade to v2

Upgrading Essentials v1.x to v2.x should be planned carefully as it's a major version release only compatible with YOOtheme Pro 4.0, which is itself a new major release. Follow these steps in the given order.

1. Make a full, restorable backup of the site.
1. Head over to _System > Plugins_ and disable the _Essentials_ plugin.
1. Upgrade YOOtheme Pro to version 4.x.
1. Upgrade Essentials to version 2.x.
1. Head over to the plugins manager and enable back the _Essentials_ plugin.

Thoroughly clear all caches, and test. If anything goes wrong, restore the backup and reach out support.
