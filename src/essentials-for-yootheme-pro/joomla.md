## Installation

Download the Free or Premium `Essentials_YOOthemePro_{version}_j3.zip` package from [ZOOlanders Downloads](https://www.zoolanders.com/downloads).

> A Premium version will be available only if you have a valid subscription and are logged in.

Follow the official [Joomla](https://docs.joomla.org/Installing_an_extension) plugin installation guide and make sure a plugin named `Essential Addons for YOOtheme Pro` is listed and enabled in the Joomla Plugins control panel, if not, enabled it manually.

> The plugin will be installed under the `plugins/system/yooessentials` directory.

## Updating

Whenever a new version is available, you will receive a notification in the `Joomla Extensions Update` control panel. Within it, you can easily update with a one-click action. For the Premium version, you will have to set your [ZOOlanders Download ID](#download-id).

A ZOOlanders Download ID is an alphanumeric code created in the [ZOOlanders Download IDs section](https://zoolanders.com/account/download-ids) that is required to update the Premium version. If you are using the Free version you can skip these steps.

Once you have created and copied a Download ID you are ready to set it in your site. Note that you can create as many IDs as necessary.

::: warning Don't upload by FTP
Even if technically possible, we strongly discourage this method as update scripts will be omitted, resulting in unexpected outcomes.

In the Joomla Plugins Control Panel find the ZOOlanders Installer plugin, access its settings, and paste the Download ID into the field.

::: tip
You can alternatively update manually by downloading the latest package version from the [Downloads](https://www.zoolanders.com/downloads) section and installing it over using the Joomla Installer control panel.
