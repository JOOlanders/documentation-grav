# Icons

Expand the icon library with custom and curated third-party collections such as Font Awesome, Bootstrap, Ionicons, and others. Resulting in a combined collection of more than 12k icons natively integrated into the builder icons workflow.

## 1. Add an Icon Collection

Before being able to choose an icon we must first install a collection within the [Icon Collections manager](/essentials-for-yootheme-pro/settings.html#icon-collections).
