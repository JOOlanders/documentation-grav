# Icons Overview

Essentials Icons is a collection of +12k icons for YOOtheme Pro icon library with support for 3rd party as custom collections.

## Icon Collection

An icon collection represents a set of icons that can be added or removed collectively from the builder's icon library. You can install one of the [collections](./collections/) provided by Essentials or [create a custom collection](./custom-collection).

After installation, the collection icons will integrate natively and be available in the builder Icon Picker under the _Collections_ Tab.

## My Icons

My Icons is a collection of custom curated icons set under the scope of a Child Theme. By placing the icons in the `{childtheme}/myicons` folder the icons of the currently active Child Theme seamlessly integrate into the icon library under the My Icons tab.

You can as well group them into subfolders, e.g. `{childtheme}/myicons/group-a`, `{childtheme}/myicons/group-b`.
