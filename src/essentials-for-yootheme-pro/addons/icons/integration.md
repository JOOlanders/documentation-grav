# Integration

Lets expand the builder icon library with a third-party [icon collection](./index#icon-collection) and display one of it icons.

<!--@include: ../_partials/enable-addon.md-->

## 1. Add an Icon Collection

Before being able to choose an icon we must first install a collection within the [Icon Collections manager](/essentials-for-yootheme-pro/settings#icon-collections).

1. Open the manager within _Customizer -> Essentials_ panel.
1. Click on the _Add Collection_ button and choose some collection.
1. Wait until the collection is listed in the manager.

## 2. Display an Icon

Now that a collection is installed we are ready to use them in our layouts.
