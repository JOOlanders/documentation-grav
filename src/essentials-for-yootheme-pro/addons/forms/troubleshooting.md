# Forms Issues

Learn how to handle common issues with essential forms.

## Submission Fails With Vague Error

The form displays a _Submission Failed_ error without any further details, it is most likely a suppressed PHP error. To get more insights about it you can:

- Check the server PHP's recent error logs.
- Open the Customizer and submit the form again making sure _Error Reporting_ is enabled.

::: tip Enable Error Reporting
Error reporting can be enabled in Joomla Global Configuration or in WordPress `wp-config.php` file.

## Submission Fails With No Error

The form does not display any visual feedback regarding the error, it could be the `.htaccess` redirecting the `post` request.

The best way to debug this is to check if:

- In the browser console. check if a request redirect is happening when the form is submitted.
- In the `.htaccess` file, check if there is any rule that is affecting the _URL_, eg removing/adding a trailing slash.

If this is the case, you can either remove such a rule or make it more specific, for example by restricting the redirect to only affect GET requests, like so:

Before

```sh
# Remove Trailing Slash
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)/$ /$1 [R=301,NC,L]
```

After

```sh
# Remove Trailing Slash
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} GET
RewriteRule ^(.*)/$ /$1 [R=301,NC,L]
```

## Email Delivery

When dealing with email we must distinguish between sending and delivery. While we can assure the email has been sent we cannot warranty it has been delivered, as that is beyond our control. Most of the time emails are not delivered because of server misconfiguration, but also because are simply discarded by the destination server.

To rise the delivery rate it is important to ensure the emails are being sent from a trusted source, which is only possible with an SMTP server or 3rd party service.

::: tip Delivery Test
We recommend the free service from [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/) which allows you to test if an email has been sent and give it delivery punctuation. If you don't want to open an account feel free to reach out to our support and we will assist you using ours.

## SPAM

SPAM is a problem that impacts all publicly accessible forms and fighting is complicated by the fact that spammers and bots are constantly evolving their methods. There are a number of solutions you can use to reduce the amount of spam, but note that thereâ€™s not any single anti-spam method in the world able to catch 100% of it.

You can find hundreds of different anti-spam techniques and services, being the most popular ones captcha-based solutions, and the honeypot technique, which we both support and recommend using together. Simply drop reCaptcha or hCatpcha element together with Honeypot element in any form and fulfill the settings. That should considerably reduce the amount, but remember that no solution is definitive.
