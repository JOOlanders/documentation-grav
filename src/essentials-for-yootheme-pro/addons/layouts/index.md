Create custom layout libraries which layouts can be stored locally or shared across multiple sites through the use of external storage options like FTP or Amazon S3.

By setting a custom layout library within the [Layout Libraries Manager](#layout-libraries-manager), you can load and browse page builder layouts in a workflow similar to the core [Layout Library](https://yootheme.com/support/yootheme-pro/joomla/layout-library). However, a custom library come with some valuable enhancements.

## Cross-Site Layout Sharing

Thanks to the library's integration with various storage options, you have the ability to specify whether your layouts are located locally or externally. For instance, if you opt to use FTP or Amazon S3 as your storage option, you can utilize the same location for your layouts across multiple sites, enabling you to share layouts seamlessly between different sites.

For an overview of the storage workflow and it capabilities, consult the [Storage Abstraction](/essentials-for-yootheme-pro/storage-abstraction) section.

## Enhanced User Interface

The user interface of the custom layout library is designed to be more advanced and user-friendly, featuring support for bulk layout management. This enables you to efficiently manage multiple layouts at once, making it easier to streamline your workflow and save time.
