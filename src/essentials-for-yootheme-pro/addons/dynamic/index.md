# Dynamic Addon

Expand the possibilities of YOOtheme Pro Dynamic Content with per-field sources, source inheritance, global queries, dynamic query arguments and more.

# Integration

<!--@include: ../_partials/enable-addon.md-->

Now that the Dynamic Content workflow has been expanded to include [Per-Field Dynamic Content](./per-field-dynamic-content) and [Global Queries](./global-queries), take the time to delve into both concepts. Incorporate them into your layouts as needed, using the familiar approach, but now with a wider range of mapping options available.
