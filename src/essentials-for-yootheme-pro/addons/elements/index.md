# Elements Addon

Create visually appealing charts from static and dynamic data, process markdown content or let users share your website's content on their social media.

Essential elements can be found in the element library under `Essentials`. They are standard YOOtheme Pro [elements](https://yootheme.com/support/yootheme-pro/joomla/elements), to learn more about general element settings, see the corresponding documentation.

## Integration

<!--@include: ../_partials/enable-addon-->

At this point Essential Elements should be listed in the builder element library and ready to be added to any layout.
