# Sources

Set multi-instance sources each with a different configurations.

A multi-instance source is based on the same core principles introduced by [Dynamic Content](https://yootheme.com/support/yootheme-pro/joomla/dynamic-content) sources, but allows running multiple identical instance parallel. New instances schema is stored in the builder GraphQL Schema, being the final result and performance identical as of a standard source.
