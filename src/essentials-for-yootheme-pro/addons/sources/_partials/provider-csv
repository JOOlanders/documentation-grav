## CSV Source

![CSV Source](./assets/provider-csv.svg)

The **CSV Source** feeds data from local files formatted as CSV (comma-separated values) or TSV (tab-separated values), supporting dynamic filtering/ordering. Based on the [multi-instance](/essentials-for-yootheme-pro/addons/sources/multi-instance-sources) source workflow it allows loading multiple files with different configurations.
