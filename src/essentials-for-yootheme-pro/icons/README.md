# Getting Started

[Icons](https://zoolanders.com/essentials-for-yootheme-pro/icons/) addon extends YOOtheme Pro builder with natively integrated icon [collections](./collections.md), ready to use in the _Builder Icon Picker_.

Let's render our very first icon, for which we must beforehand install a collection.

1. Access _**Essentials**_ -> _**Icon Collections**_ section in the YOOtheme Pro Customizer.
1. Notice that existing collections will be listed in this section.
1. Now click on the *Add Collection* button and choose a collection you want to add.
1. At this point the new collection will become available as part of the _Builder Icon Picker_ workflow under the Collections tab.
