# Updating

## Joomla

Whenever a new version is available, you will receive a notification in the `Joomla Extensions Update` control panel. Within it, you can easily update with a one-click action. For the Premium version, you will have to set your [ZOOlanders Download ID](#download-id).

A ZOOlanders Download ID is an alphanumeric code created in the [ZOOlanders Download IDs section](https://zoolanders.com/account/download-ids) that is required to update the Premium version. If you are using the Free version you can skip these steps.

Once you have created and copied a Download ID you are ready to set it in your site. Note that you can create as many IDs as necessary.

Even if technically possible, we strongly discourage this method as update scripts will be omitted, resulting in unexpected outcomes.
