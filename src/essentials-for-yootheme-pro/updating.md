# Updating

Whenever a new version is available, you will receive a notification in the `Joomla Extensions Update` or `WordPress Plugins` control panel. Within it, you can easily update with a one-click action. For the Premium version, you will have to set your [ZOOlanders Download ID](#download-id).

A ZOOlanders Download ID is an alphanumeric code created in the [ZOOlanders Download IDs section](https://zoolanders.com/account/download-ids) that is required to update the Premium version. If you are using the Free version you can skip these steps.

Once you have created and copied a Download ID you must save it in the site, action that slightly differs in Joomla and WordPress.

For Joomla go to the Plugins control panel and find the _ZOOlanders Installer Plugin_, access its settings, and paste the Download ID into the field.

For WordPress go to the Global Settings menu and find the _ZOOlanders Settings Panel_, access it, and paste the Download ID into the field.

::: tip
You can alternatively update manually by downloading the latest package version from the [Downloads](https://www.zoolanders.com/downloads) section and installing it over. The installation process will detect a previous installation and make an update instead.
