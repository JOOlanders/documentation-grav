# Getting Started

[Access](https://zoolanders.com/essentials-for-yootheme-pro/access) addon extends YOOtheme Pro builder elements with rendering conditions that will be evaluated against the logic and configuration set by extendable [rules](./rules.md). Let's create our first condition.

1. In the _Customizer Builder_ add and element to which to apply a restriction.
1. Access that element _Advanced Tab_ settings.
1. Locate the **Access** field and click on the _Conditions_ button to open the conditions panel.
1. Add one or more rules clicking on the `plus` sign and fullfill it settings.
1. If you have set more than one rules you can choose to evaluate those with an `AND` or `OR` logic.
1. At this point the element should render, or not, depending on the rules configuration.

::: tip
When an element is conditioned a `lock` icon will be displayed in the Builder giving a hint about it. You can click on it to immediately open the conditions panel.

Now go and explore all the available [rules](./rules/user) or [create your own](advanced/custom-rule).
