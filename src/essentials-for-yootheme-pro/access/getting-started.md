# Getting Started

1. **Choose an Element**. Choose an element to which to apply a restriction. In it Advanced Tab settings, locate the Access field setting and enter the Configuration panel.

2. **Set a Condition**. In the configuration Panel enable one or more rules for the condition to be evaluated, eg. `Time`.

<video width="800" controls>
  <source src="./assets/configuration.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

At this point the element should render, or not, depending on the current server time and the rule configuration. When an element is being evaluated an icon is displayed in the Builder element giving a hint about the rendering conditioning.

Now go and explore all the core available [rules](./rules.md) or create your own.
