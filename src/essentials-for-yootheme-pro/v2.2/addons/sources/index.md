# Dynamic Sources Overview

Generate dynamic content sources from configuration or service-dependent data, such as database tables, CSV files, Instagram media, Google Spreadsheets, and more.

## Multi Instance

A multi-instance source is based on the same core principles introduced by [YOOtheme Pro Dynamic Content](https://yootheme.com/support/yootheme-pro/joomla/dynamic-content) sources, but allows running multiple identical instances in parallel. New instances schema is stored in the builder GraphQL Schema, being the final result and performance identical as of a standard source.
