## Updating Essentials

Essentials can be updated using the platform's update system. Whenever a new version is available, you will receive a notification in the platform dashboard. Before you can update, ensure that you have added your Essentials Download ID.

### Download ID

An Essentials Download ID is a unique alphanumeric code generated for each website. It is required to update Essentials. You can find and manage your Download IDs in the [Download IDs](https://zoolanders.com/account/download-ids) section of your account.
