title: Essentials Integration
---

Essentials is in essence a plugin and has to be installed like any other Joomla or WordPress plugin. {% .lead %}

Follow through the [installation](#installation), then choose which [addons](addons) to integrate for your current project. This will allow you to customize your experience and only use the addons that are relevant to your needs. Optionally, set up [automatic updates](#automatic-updates), to ensure that you have always the latest version.

## Installation

[Download](https://www.zoolanders.com/downloads) the required platform version, then follow the targeted platform installation guide, [Joomla](https://docs.joomla.org/Installing_an_extension) or [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#installing-plugins-1).

After a successful installation, a plugin named **Essentials YOOtheme Pro** (a.k.a. `yooessentials`) should be listed and enabled.

{% callout title="Installation Folder" %}
The plugin will be installed under the `plugins/system/yooessentials` for Joomla and `wp-contents/plugins/yooessentials` directory for WordPress.
{% /callout %}

## Automatic Updates

New available versions will be notified in the **Joomla Extensions Update** or **WordPress Plugins** control panels. Within it, you can easily update with a one-click action considering that for the Premium version, you will have to set a [ZOOlanders Download ID](#download-id) first.

{% callout title="Manuall Update" %}
You can as well update manually by [downloading](https://www.zoolanders.com/downloads) the latest version and installing over. A previous installation will be detected and an update made instead.
{% /callout %}

## Download ID

A ZOOlanders Download ID is an alphanumeric code created in the [ZOOlanders Download IDs section](https://zoolanders.com/account/download-ids) that is required to update the Premium version.

Once you have created a Download ID you must set it in your site, an action that slightly differs on each platform.

In the **Joomla Plugins** control panel locate the **ZOOlanders Installer Plugin**, then input the Download ID into the plugin settings.

In the **WordPress Global Settings** menu locate the **ZOOlanders Settings Panel**, then input the Download ID into the panel settings.
