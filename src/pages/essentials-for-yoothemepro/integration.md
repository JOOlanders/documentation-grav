## Installation

Essentials is in essence a plugin and has to be installed like any other Joomla or WordPress plugin. [Download](https://www.zoolanders.com/downloads) the required platform version, then follow the specific installation guide.

- [Joomla](https://docs.joomla.org/Installing_an_extension)
- [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#installing-plugins-1)

After a successful installation, a plugin named Essentials YOOtheme Pro (a.k.a `yooessentials`) should be listed and enabled.

{% callout title="Installation Folder" %}
The plugin will be installed under the `plugins/system/yooessentials` for Joomla and `wp-contents/plugins/yooessentials` directory for WordPress.
{% /callout %}

## Update

New available versions will be notified in the `Joomla Extensions Update` or `WordPress Plugins` control panels. Within it, you can easily update with a one-click action considering that for the Premium version, you will have to set your [ZOOlanders Download ID](#download-id).

{% callout title="Manuall Update" %}
You can as well update manually by [downloading](https://www.zoolanders.com/downloads) the latest version and installing over. A previous installation will be detected and an update made instead.

## Download ID

A ZOOlanders Download ID is an alphanumeric code created in the [ZOOlanders Download IDs section](https://zoolanders.com/account/download-ids) that is required to update the Premium version.

Once you have created a Download ID you must set it in your site, an action that slightly differs in Joomla and WordPress.

If using Joomla, go to the plugins control panel and locate the ZOOlanders Installer Plugin. Input the Download ID into the plugin settings.

If WordPress, go to the Global Settings menu and locate the ZOOlanders Settings Panel, input the Download ID into the panel settings.
