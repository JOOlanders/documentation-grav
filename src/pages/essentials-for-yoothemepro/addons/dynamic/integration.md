Now that the Dynamic Content workflow has been expanded to include [Per-Field Dynamic Content](../per-field-dynamic-content) and [Global Queries](../global-queries), take the time to delve into both concepts. Incorporate them into your layouts as needed, using the familiar approach, but now with a wider range of mapping options available.
