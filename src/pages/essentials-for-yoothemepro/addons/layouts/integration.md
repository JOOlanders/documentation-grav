title: Layouts Addon Integration
---

Follow through to learn how to create a custom builder layout library from a local or external storage. Even if you are already familiar with the concept you might learn something new. {% .lead %}

Ensure Essentials has been installed correctly by following the [installation guide](/essentials-for-yoothemepro/integration#installation). From there, open the `Customizer -> Essentials -> Advanced` section and enable the **Layouts Addon**, then save the changes and refresh the page.

## 1. Create Library

Let's create a custom layout library within the manager.

1. Open the `Customizer -> Essentials -> Layout Libraries` section.
1. Click on the `New Library` button and set a name for it.

## 2. Create Library Storage

In this case we are going to set a library with a local storage, but you can opt to set an external storage and that way enable layouts cross-site sharing.

{% /image %}

1. In the `Storage` field click on the storage picker.
1. Choose `local` storage or of choice.
1. Another modal will open, set the name and details.
1. Save the storage and library by clicking `Save` on both opened modals.

## 2. Save Layout To Library

The new library will appear in the [Layout Library](https://yootheme.com/support/yootheme-pro/joomla/layout-library) modal Tab with the name used during it creation as well as in the elements presets modal. You can now save and load layouts within the new Library in the same way you are already used to.
