An Icon Collection is a group of icons bundled together that can be added or removed from the builder icon library collectively. Once installed, the icons will natively integrate and become available for selection in the `Collections Tab` of the builder Icon Picker.

You can find a full list and details of third-party collections in the [collections reference](collections) section.
