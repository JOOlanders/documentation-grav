Essentials Settings hold most of Essentials Addons configuration under the _Essentials_ namespace of the Customizer root menu.

---

## Import/Export

Being Essentials Settings independent from the Theme, the only way to backup and/or restore is using the dedicated methods within `Customizer -> Essentials -> Advanced` panel.

---

## Addons Execution

In the `Customizer -> Essentials -> Advanced` panel toggle the loading of addons individually. A disabled addon will be completely skipped from execution and is a good way to debug issues or to keep the execution as smooth as possible.
