title: Field Sources
---

**Field Sources** simplifies the creation of advanced layouts with dynamic content.  {% .lead %}

**Field Sources** expand on the YOOtheme Pro [Field Mapping](https://yootheme.com/support/yootheme-pro/joomla/dynamic-content#field-mapping) concept with the possibility to choose the source for each field individually. By default, the core worklow limits the mapping to the content of the source selected on the element level which is, per design, limited. By removing that limitation becomes possible the creation of advanced layouts using just core elements.

In the case of a multi-item query set on a field, you will be able to choose if the results will be joined with a glue string before or after the field filters, or leave the value raw and allow the underlying element or workflow to deal with the array of data.
