title: Global Queries
---

**Global Queries** speed up and simplifies the creation of layouts that use complex queries over and over. {% .lead %}

**Global Queries** expand the YOOtheme Pro [Dynamic Content](https://yootheme.com/support/yootheme-pro/joomla/dynamic-content) workflow adding the possibility to set source queries globally available. When a new query is created it will become a standard source option available for mapping at any builder element.

---

## The Manager

The source queries are managed in the **Global Queries Manager** that can be accessed at `Customizer -> Essentials -> Global Queries` panel. There is possible to create a new query for any source that is globally available, which excludes Page Queries. The query can be edited at any moment, and ultimately deleted if not needed anymore.

In case the panel is not present make sure the **Dynamic Addon** is enabled in the [Essentials Settings](../settings).
