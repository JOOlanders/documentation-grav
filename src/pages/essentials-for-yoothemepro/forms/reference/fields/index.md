Basic form field elements are provided out of the box, these represent standard HTML form elements supported natively by [UIkit](https://getuikit.com/) and can be found in the [element library](https://yootheme.com/support/yootheme-pro/joomla/element-library) under Form Essentials group.

{% callout type="warning" title="Custom Fields" %}
Even though it is possible to define a form field using plain HTML, the [Dynamic Workflow](dynamic) will not be completely aware of these. When possible, opt to create a custom element if core ones don't suffice.
