title: Form Area
---

A Form Area is a builder Section or Column enabled as an area that defines where the form will be structured. {% .lead %}

The area is wrapped with a standard [\<form\>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) HTML Element without loosing builder capabilities, which implies that any valid form field markup inside it, e.g. a raw HTML `<input>`, it will be picked up during submission.

Each area is scoped with it unique fields, settings and workflow, making it possible to have multiple forms on the same page.

## Settings

Manage the Form Area settings and workflow. {% .lead %}

Once a Form Area has been [created](integration#create-a-form-area), it settings will become available in the chosen Section or Column Advanced Panel.

{% /image %}

Optional `id`, `name` and `class` attributes for the form node allow further customizations.

{% image %}
![Form Action Override](/assets/ytp/forms/formarea-settings-sub-override.webp)
{% /image %}

Override the form **action** and **method** in order to submit the form to a 3rd party service or a custom URL. When enabled, the server side validation will be omited.

## Fields

Structure forms with native field elements. {% .lead %}

![Field Elements](/assets/ytp/forms/fields/elements.webp)

Basic form field elements are provided out of the box, these represent standard HTML form elements supported natively by [UIkit](https://getuikit.com/) and can be found in the [element library](https://yootheme.com/support/yootheme-pro/joomla/element-library) under Form Essentials group.

Use them to set the form structure as well to establish individual validation and specfics. For integration and further details, please consult the [Fields Reference](reference/fields) section.

## CAPTCHA

Protect forms from SPAM with CAPTCHA. {% .lead %}

![Captcha Elements](/assets/ytp/forms/captcha/elements.webp)

A [CAPTCHA](http://www.captcha.net) is a type of challengeâ€“response test used to determine whether the user is human. There are several 3rd party captcha based service providers supported out of the box, these can be found in the [element library](https://yootheme.com/support/yootheme-pro/joomla/element-library) under Form Essentials group.

Use them to set a workflow that will protect the form from SPAM and abuse. For integration and further details, please consult the [Captcha Reference](reference/captcha) section.

---

## Validation

Validate the data before it reachs the server. {% .lead %}

Submissions are validated first by the browser's native HTML5 validation, and once again via server-side ajax request. Only if both evaluate as positive, the form will be submitted. If desired, HTML5 validation can be disabled in the [Form Area settings](#settings).

Individual form field validation rules are set independently on each Field Element under the Validation Tab. For integration and further details, please consult the [Fields Reference](reference/fields) section.
