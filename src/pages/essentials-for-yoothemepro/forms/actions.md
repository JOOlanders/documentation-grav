title: After Submit Actions
---

By design, submission data is not processed, saved, or logged unless there is an After Submit Action set for the task. These are multi-instance functions that will run sequentially after a form has been validated and successfully submitted. It is a simple, yet powerful way to give you full control over the submission workflow, which you can manage the [Form Area Settings](#form-area-settings).

{% callout title="Custom Actions" %}
Core actions will solve most form workflow needs, but it is relatively simple to add [custom actions](./forms/customizations#custom-after-submit-actions) as well.
{% /callout %}
