Before a submission is accepted the data must be validated. {% .lead %}

For a submission to be accepted and further processed it must pass the [fields validation](#fields-validation) as well as the [CAPTCHA validation](#captcha-validation), if any.

## Fields Validation

Fields are validated first by the browser's native HTML5 validation, and once again via server-side ajax request. If desired, HTML5 validation can be disabled in the [Form Area Settings](form-area#settings).

Validation rules are set independently on each Field Element under the Validation Tab. For integration and further details, please consult the [Fields Reference](fields) section.

{% callout type="warning" title="Custom Error Message" %}
Customizing the validation error messages is currently only possible for server-side validation.
{% /callout %}

## CAPTCHA Validation

![Captcha Elements](/assets/ytp/forms/captcha/elements.webp)

A [CAPTCHA](http://www.captcha.net) is a type of challengeâ€“response test used to determine whether the user is human. There are several 3rd party captcha based service providers supported out of the box, these can be found in the [element library](https://yootheme.com/support/yootheme-pro/joomla/element-library) under Form Essentials group.

Use them to set a workflow that will protect the form from SPAM and abuse. For integration and further details, please consult the [Captcha Reference](captcha) section.
