Protect your forms from SPAM with CAPTCHA. {% .lead %}

A [CAPTCHA](http://www.captcha.net) is a type of challengeâ€“response test used in computing to determine whether the user is human. Captcha elements can be found in the [element library](https://yootheme.com/support/yootheme-pro/joomla/element-library) under Form Essentials.

There are several 3rd party CAPTCHA service providers supported out of the box, they all work similarly, although some might have a stricter [GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr) approach, or enterprise-focused features. Evaluate which one fits best your project, but don't combine them, choose only one per project page.
