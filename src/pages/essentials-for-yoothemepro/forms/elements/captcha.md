Protect your forms from SPAM with CAPTCHA. {% .lead %}

A [CAPTCHA](http://www.captcha.net) is a type of challengeâ€“response test used to determine whether the user is human. There are several 3rd party captcha based service providers supported out of the box, and although they all work similarly, some might have a stricter [GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr) approach, or enterprise-focused features that suits your project best.

Captcha elements can be found in the [element library](https://yootheme.com/support/yootheme-pro/joomla/element-library) under Form Essentials group. Refer to each element documentation for integration details.
