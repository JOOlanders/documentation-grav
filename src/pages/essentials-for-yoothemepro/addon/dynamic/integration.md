Follow through to learn how to map content directly from a source. Even if you are already familiar with the concept you might learn something new. {% .lead %}

Before starting, make sure Essentials has been properly [installed](../../integration), then access the `Customizer -> Essentials -> Advanced` section and enable the **Dynamic Addon**. Save the changes and refresh the page.

## Follow Through

Next, start building your layouts using advanced dynamic features such as [Field Sources](./dynamic/field-sources), [Global Queries](dynamic/global-queries), and others.

## 1.

Dynamic Options

Above each element field a **Dynamic** button will appear allowing to map a dynamic content whether the element has set a source in the **Advanced Tab** or not. The **Dynamic Options** will vary, however, depending on the element, the parent element and global queries configuration.
