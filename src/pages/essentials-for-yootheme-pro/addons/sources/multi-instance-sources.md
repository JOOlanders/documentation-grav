title: Multi-Instance Sources
---

Set content source instances running in paralel with different configurations. {% .lead %}

A Multi-Instance Source is based on the same core principles introduced by [Dynamic Content](https://yootheme.com/support/yootheme-pro/joomla/dynamic-content) sources, but allows running multiple identical instance parallel. New instances schema is stored in the builder GraphQL Schema, being the final result and performance identical as of a standard source.

## Source Manager

The Source Manager can be accessed at `Customizer -> Essentials -> Sources` section. There you can manage source instances which will become part of the Dynamic Content workflow.

## Source Authentication

This is the process where you grant permission to access private content or perform actions on your behalf that is required by a source, e.g. accessing media from an Instagram Business account. Learn more about [OAuth, Keys and Secrets](/essentials-for-yootheme-pro/oauth-keys-secrets) managed by Essentials.
