Compose a source by combining text and any dynamic content. {% .lead %}

[Dynamic Content](https://yootheme.com/support/yootheme-pro/joomla/dynamic-content) workflow allows you to extend the way you assign content to an element. In any field that has a dynamic field mapped, a new icon will appear.
Once clicked, it will open a new panel with a dedicated editor that can be used to compose a source by mixing regular text and values taken from any dynamic content you have available.

## Compose Dynamic Content

Once you are inside the editor you will see that the dynamic content you previously set in the field is already inserted into the content.
Now you can just start typing any additional content you may want to add, or even add new dynamic content to it.

{% /image %}

To do so, just press the `Add Dynamic` button on the top right of the editor, and choose any field of the current dynamic content.
You can also choose any other dynamic content from any other source, by pressing the 3 dots icon on the top right. Check the dedicated documentation for more information on how to use our Advanced Dynamic Content Workflow.

## Add Filters

Once a dynamic content placeholer has been added to the content, you can click on it to show the filters interface that you're used to.
Once you're done editing the filters, just click outside of the dropdown to see the changes reflected in the page you're editing.

## Set an Alias

Sometimes the placeholder name can get too long or not really meaningful for you usage. For these cases, you can set an alias by clicking on the placeholder, and then click on the `Set alias` link near the name of the source.
Fill in any name there, and it will be used in the placeholder tag instead of the default one. Don't worry, this has no impact at all on the rendering of the page, it's just an editing utility!
