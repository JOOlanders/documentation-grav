title: Upgrade Essentials to 2.0
---

Essentials 2.0 is a major version release, and it's only compatible with YOOtheme Pro 4.0, which is itself a new major release.

To avoid any issue during the update, we've put in place some check that prevents the plugin to be run in the wrong YOOtheme Pro version.

## Upgrade

In order to update, you need to:

1. Backup your site
2. Test that the backup is functional
3. Disable Essentials for YOOtheme Pro plugin
4. Update YOOtheme Pro to version 4
5. Update Essentials for YOOtheme Pro to version 2.0
6. Enable Essentials for YOOtheme Pro plugin.

If you need more details on the installation itself, follow through the [installation](#installation), then choose which [addons](../addons) to integrate for your current project. This will allow you to customize your experience and only use the addons that are relevant to your needs. Optionally, set up [automatic updates](#automatic-updates), to ensure that you have always the latest version.
