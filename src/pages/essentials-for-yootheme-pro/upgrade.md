Upgrading to Essentials 2.0 should be plan carefully as it's a major version release only compatible with YOOtheme Pro 4.0, which is itself a new major release. Follow these steps in the given order.

1. Make a full, restorable backup of the site.

1. In the Joomla backend head over to `System > Extensions > Plugins` and **disable** the *Essentials* plugin. In WordPress head over to `Plugins` and **deactivate** *the Essentials* plugin.

1. Upgrade YOOtheme Pro to version 4.x.

1. Upgrade Essentials to version 2.x.

1. In the Joomla backend head over to `System > Extensions > Plugins` and **enable** the *Essentials* plugin. In WordPress head over to `Plugins` and **activate** *the Essentials* plugin.

Thoroughly clear all caches, and test. If anything goes wrong, restore the backup.
