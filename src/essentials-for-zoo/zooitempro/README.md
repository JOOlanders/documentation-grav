## Filter/Order

ZOOitemPro provides an advanced filtering and ordering for the rendered Items. The most important ones are:

**Filter**

- `Apps`: Filters the Items by the Apps they are part of. No selection equals to all.
- `Types`: Filters the Items by their Types. No selection equals to all.
- `Categories`: Filters the Items by the Categories they are part of. No selection equals to all.
- `Tags`: Filters the Items by the Tags they are tagged with. No selection equals to all.
- `Author`: Filters the Items by their Authors. Values are set with User IDs delimited by a comma. The `[userid]` variable can be used to add the ID of the current User.
- `Published State`: Filters the Items by their Published State.
- `Frontpage State`: Filters the Items by their Frontpage State.
- `Offset`: The query offset.
- `Limit`: The query limit.
- `Created`: Filters the Items by its created date.
- `Modified`: Filters the Items by its modified date.
- `Published Up`: Filters the Items by its published up date.
- `Published Down`: Filters the Items by its published down date.

::: tip
Dates inputs support **[yesterday]**, **[today]** and **[tomorrow]** variables allowing dynamic filtering.
:::

::: warning
Filtering on repeatable dates is not supported.
:::

**Order**

- `Random`: Sets a random order for the filtered items.
- `Reverse`: Reverse the final ordering.
- `Priority`: If enabled the Items priority would be considered for the ordering.
- `Alphanumeric`: Allows choosing if the ordering should be done with alphanumeric values. Enable if your order is failing, specially if there are numbers involved.
- `Core`: Allows to choose the core element by which will be made the order.

> More options are available for the Element specific filtering and ordering depending of the App/Type selected.

## Customizations

### Custom Module Layouts

Creating custom layouts for ZOOitemPro is strightforward, just duplicate the Default layout file and folder and start adapting those as you needed.

::: tip
You can place your custom layouts in the Joomla Theme overriding folders.
:::

### Custom ZOO Render Layouts

The default render layouts are sometimes not enough, luckily is possible creating custom ones following the [ZOO Custom Module Layouts Guide](https://yootheme.com/support/zoo/custom-module-layouts). Notice that the guide references the `mod_zooitem` module, but the same practice can be done with the pro version changing the paths to `mod_zooitempro`.

> ZOOitemPro will respect your changes in the `renderer` folder during updates.

### Custom Elements support

In order to filter by custom elements, those must have specified the ZL Filter group **Category**, **Date**, **Input**, **Option** or **Rating** in the manifest declaration:

1. Open the custom element **XML** manifest file and localize the `<element>` tag.
2. Add the `zl_filter_group` attribute with the appropriate category value.

The resultant tag should look like `<element type="{type}" zl_filter_group="{group}">`.
