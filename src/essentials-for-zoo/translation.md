# Translation

You may want to install as well the INI translation files for all the languages your site should support. Similarly as in the previous section, [download the required translation packages](http://static.zoolanders.com/translations/) and install them using the _Joomla! Extension Manager_ or upload the files manually into the `administrator/language/{LANGUAGE}` folder.

> If a language is missing or incomplete, you can contribute to the translation at [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/joolanders/zoolanders/).
