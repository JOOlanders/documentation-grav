# Issues with SEO

## Category Open Graph

The Open Graph meta tags can only be applied to ZOO Item views.

## The metadata is not being displaying on the Item page

Make sure the ZOOlanders ZOOseo Plugin is enabled and that the _ZOOseo Metadata Item_ layout is populated.

## The Open Graph tags are not being recognized

Some services, like Facebook, cannot scrape the website when _Joomla! GZIP_ compression is enabled. As currently there is no workaround for it, the best is to keep the compression off when using Open Graph.
